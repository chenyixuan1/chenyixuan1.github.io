<center><font size=18>**What is asthma?**</font></center>
<font size=14>Asthma is the result of chronic inflammation of the conducting zone of the airways (most especially the bronchi and bronchioles), which subsequently results in increased contractability of the surrounding smooth muscles. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These episodes may occur a few times a day or a few times per week. Depending on the person, they may become worse at night or with exercise.</font></br>

<font size=14>Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.  During recovery from an attack, it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils. Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air. Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may have marked and persistent symptoms.</font></br>

For example, if one identical twin is affected, the probability of the other having the disease is approximately 25%. Or if your parents or close relatives have asthma, you are more at risk of developing asthma.</font></br>
</br>
<font size=14><font color=blue>**2. Allergenic & Non-Allergenic**</font>
Some allergenic factors that can lead to exacerbation of asthma include dust mites, animal dander (especially cat and dog hair), cockroach allergens and mold. Perfumes are a common cause of acute attacks in women and children. Both viral and bacterial infections of the upper respiratory tract can worsen the disease.</br>
There are also some non-allergenic factors can lead to asthma include psychological stress, exercise, virus, cold air, air pollution etc.</font></br>
